# Deterministic-SIRD-Model-Tuberculosis-Cambodia

The goal of this project was to simulate a Deterministic SIRD Model with Vital Dynamics on Cambodia's Tuberculosis dataset from the years 2012 to 2019. The SIRD model with vital dynamics uses a series of differential equations to showcase the spread of a disease. A report is attached that showcases the culmination of the project. The simulations were done in the programming languages of R and SAS and was presented to the STAT 495 Special Topics in Statistics Class in May 2024. The project was graded by Dr. Olga Korosteleva, undergraduate advisor and professor of statistics at CSULB.
